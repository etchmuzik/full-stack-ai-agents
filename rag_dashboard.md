# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Dashboard

This dashboard tracks the status of the retrieval layer used by your agents.

## Components

- **Indexing pipeline**: Converts your codebase and documentation into vector embeddings.
- **Vector store**: Stores the embeddings, enabling quick similarity search.
- **Retriever**: Given a query, finds relevant chunks from the vector store.
- **Generator**: Uses Claude or ChatGPT to synthesize answers from retrieved content.

## Status Indicators

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Index freshness** | Date of last index update (e.g., after new code commits) |
| **Index size** | Number of documents/chunks indexed |
| **Query latency** | Average time to retrieve relevant documents |
| **Response accuracy** | Percentage of answers that match ground truth or user satisfaction |

## Daily Checklist

1. **Update index**: Re-run the indexing pipeline after significant code changes or documentation updates.
2. **Monitor latency**: Ensure retrieval times remain within acceptable limits (e.g., under 1 second per query).
3. **Validate samples**: Periodically test the system with sample questions and verify that the retrieved content is relevant.
4. **Adjust chunk size**: If relevant context is missing or latency is high, tweak the chunk size during indexing.
5. **Inspect error logs**: Review any errors or exceptions thrown during retrieval or generation.

## Maintenance Tasks

- **Rebuild the index** weekly or bi-weekly to prevent drift.
- **Tune embedding models**: Evaluate different embedding models (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, Azure) for best performance.
- **Scale vector store**: Upgrade your database or infrastructure as the number of documents grows.
- **Backup data**: Ensure backups of your index and vector store are kept in case of data loss.

## Integration Notes

- Both Claude and ChatGPT agents can call the RAG layer via API or local server.
- Ensure API endpoints or local ports are secured.
- Consider caching frequently asked questions to reduce load on the retrieval system.
